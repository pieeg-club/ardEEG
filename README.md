## To Buy -   ardEEG is available in the  [market](https://pieeg.com/ardeeg/)
[LinkedIn for updates](https://www.linkedin.com/company/96475004/admin/feed/posts/) 

## Easy start

Just only 2 script one for [Arduino](https://github.com/Ildaron/ardEEG/blob/main/software/arduino/1.Send_data_via_wifi.ino) and for Python [Python](https://github.com/Ildaron/ardEEG/blob/main/software/python/1.Alpha_real_time.py) in Windows (etc) and full support from [PiEEG](https://pieeg.com/)))



This project is the result of several years of work on the development of BCI. We believe that the easiest way to get started with biosignals is to use a shield.
We will try to reveal the process of reading EEG signals as fully and clearly as possible. 

#### Warnings
>[!WARNING]
> You are fully responsible for your personal decision to purchase this device and, ultimately, for its safe use. PiEEG is not a medical device and has not been certified by any government regulatory agency for use with the human body. Use it at your own risk.

>[!CAUTION]
> The device must operate only from a battery - 5 V. Complete isolation from the mains power is required.! The device MUST not be connected to any kind of mains power, via USB or otherwise.     
> Power supply - only battery 5V
> It is not a medical device!!! And cannot be used for any medical purposes

#### How it Works   
Connect the shield to Arduino Uno R4 WiFi and after that connect the device to a battery (power supply) and connect electrodes.
Full galvanic isolation from mains is required.  
Electrodes are positioned according to the International 10-20 system    â€‹

#### Video presentation
In this [video](https://youtu.be/s_5mDDUFp6E) you can see how to measure EEG  

[![Hardware demonstrations](https://github.com/Ildaron/ardEEG/blob/main/supplementary_files/youtube.png)](https://youtu.be/s_5mDDUFp6E))   

#### Artifact test  
The process of measuring chewing and blinking artifacts using dry electrodes (Fz). Chewing occurred in the following sequence: 4 times, 3 times, 2, and 1 time, and the same for the blinking process. The y- axis is the processed EEG signal after passing filter bands of 1-40 Hz in microvolts and with 250 samples per second

#### Alpha test  
The process of recording an EEG signal from an electrode (Fz) with eyes open and closed. The y- axis is the processed EEG signal after passing filter bands of 8-12Hz in microvolts and with 250 samples per second
