PiEEG devices – PiEEG, ardEEG, JNEEG

You are fully responsible for your personal decision to purchase this device and, ultimately, for its safe use. PiEEG devices are not a medical device and has not been certified by any government regulatory agency for use with the human body. Use it at your own risk.

PiEEG devices is subject to the terms outlined below. This evaluation board/kit is exclusively intended for ENGINEERING DEVELOPMENT, DEMONSTRATION, OR EVALUATION PURPOSES and is not deemed a final end-product suitable for general consumer use.

Limitations of Liability:

PiEEG devices are not intended for medical, clinical, or diagnostic purposes, and they are supplied “as is.” PiEEG devices makes no explicit or implied warranties regarding functionality, operability, or use, including, but not limited to, any implied warranties of fitness for a specific purpose or non-infringement.PiEEG devices and absolutely for all devices that have with PiEEG devices connection are engineered to draw power exclusively from low-voltage DC sources, such as batteries, only with 5 V and are not compatible not under any circumstances (for any tasks) with power sources from the grid, power outlets, USB ports, etc.

Individuals handling the product(s) must possess electronics training and adhere to recognized engineering practices. The provided goods are not designed to fulfill all required design, marketing, and manufacturing-related protective considerations, including standard safety and environmental measures present in end products incorporating similar semiconductor components or circuit boards.

This evaluation board/kit does not fall within the scope of European Union directives concerning electromagnetic compatibility, restricted substances (RoHS), recycling (WEEE), FCC, CE, or UL, and thus may not satisfy the technical requirements of these directives or related regulations.

We explicitly disclaim any liability for direct, indirect, consequential, incidental, or special damages, including lost revenues, lost profits, losses resulting from business interruption, or loss of data, irrespective of the form of action or legal theory under which the liability may be asserted, even if awareness of such damages is provided.

Under no circumstances will PiEEG devices total liability to the end user from any and all causes (including negligence) exceed the total amount paid by the end user for the products.

This is not a device made for consumer home use. The internal electronics are exposed during normal operation to facilitate easy access by developers and professionals. As such, you must be aware of the hazards of operating exposed electronics, and are familiar with standard anti-static procedures for handling bare electrical components, or be prepared to make your own case.

There is no patient isolation circuitry on the device, so again, you must be sure to operate the PiEEG devices and all connected devices from 5V battery power.
